      Reunited and Divided is a podcast hosted by three high school friends. After graduation in 2004, George and Richard joined the United States Army, and Mark joined the United States Air Force a few years later. Separated by the military for sixteen years, after many debates on social media, they are recording their political views and broadcasting them for all the world to disagree with.
